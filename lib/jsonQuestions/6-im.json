      "question_text": "A computer programmer wants to release a game online. Discuss the features, benefits, and drawbacks of open source and proprietary software licences, and recommend one.",
      "model_answer": "Open source software is usually free and allows users to view, modify, and distribute the source code.\n\nThis means anyone can improve the software or adapt it for their own needs, potentially fixing bugs quickly or adding new features.\n\nHowever, this openness also makes it easier for someone to steal or misuse the code, and support or documentation may be limited.\n\nProprietary software keeps the source code hidden and often comes with a cost.\n\nThis provides more control to the programmer, ensures a more consistent user experience, and often includes better support and testing.\n\nHowever, it restricts how users can use or modify the software and may reduce the number of people who can afford to use it.\n\nLegally, both types of licences protect the intellectual property, but open source makes it harder to enforce restrictions.\n\nEthically, open source encourages collaboration and innovation, while proprietary software supports income generation and consistency.\n\nIn this case, if the programmer wants widespread use and community involvement, open source is ideal.\n\nIf they aim to profit and maintain control, proprietary is the better choice.\n\nA clear recommendation should be based on their goals.",

      "question_text": "Social networking websites use AI to monitor user posts. Discuss the legal, ethical, and privacy implications of this use of AI.",
      "model_answer": "Legally, AI systems must follow data protection laws such as the Data Protection Act (DPA).\n\nA benefit is that AI can automatically detect and remove illegal content like hate speech or copyrighted material, ensuring compliance.\n\nHowever, there's a risk that AI may mistakenly remove content that is not illegal content, leading to disputes and claims of censorship and legal action.\n\nEthically, using AI to moderate content can help protect users from harmful posts and prevent abuse as more posts can be checked efficiently.\n\nOn the other hand, some users may feel unfairly targeted or silenced if the AI misinterprets their posts, raising concerns about freedom of expression.\n\nIn terms of privacy, AI systems may constantly scan user content, which some users see as intrusive.\n\nWhile users usually agree to terms when signing up, they may not fully understand what data is being analyzed or stored.\n\nOthers may prefer AI moderation over human review because it feels less personal and more consistent.\n\nOverall, the system must be transparent, fair, and reviewed regularly to maintain trust.",

      "model_answer": "Ethically, using AI in research can speed up the discovery of treatments and improve accuracy, potentially saving lives.\n\nHowever, it may also lead to job losses, as AI systems replace human researchers, and reduce opportunities for career development.\n\nLegally, the use of AI must ensure patient data remains secure and complies with healthcare data protection regulations.\n\nIf AI systems make errors, it's unclear who is legally responsible—the developer, the user, or the hospital.\n\nCulturally, increased use of AI may shift the skills required in the medical field, with more emphasis on technology management rather than traditional medical expertise.\n\nThis could cause friction or resistance from staff.\n\nHowever, it may also lead to new types of jobs and a modernized healthcare system.\n\nThe challenge is to ensure that humans and AI can work together ethically, legally, and inclusively.",

      "model_answer": "For diagnosis, technology can help identify patterns in symptoms faster than humans, leading to quicker and more accurate results.\n\nHowever, there is a risk that AI might miss unusual symptoms or provide incorrect diagnoses if the data it has been trained on is limited.\n\nIn terms of treatment, advanced tools like robotic surgery and remote-controlled procedures allow doctors to treat patients with precision, even across long distances.\n\nBut reliance on technology could reduce human interaction and increase the risk of harm if systems fail or are hacked.\n\nRegarding record storage, central databases make it easier for different healthcare providers to access patient records, which can improve continuity of care.\n\nThe downside is that centralized systems can be targeted by cyberattacks, putting sensitive personal data at risk.\n\nOverall, the use of digital technology in medicine offers many benefits but must be managed carefully to avoid unintended harm.",
