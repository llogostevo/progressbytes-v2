# ProgressBytes

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Performance Optimization Plan

### 1. Implement Caching for Static Data
- [ ] Set up Next.js caching for topics and questions
  - [ ] Create cache utility functions in `app/lib/cache.ts`
  - [ ] Implement `unstable_cache` for topics and questions queries
  - [ ] Add cache revalidation triggers for admin updates
  - [ ] Set appropriate cache durations (e.g., 1 hour for topics)

- [ ] Optimize database queries
  - [ ] Add indexes for frequently queried fields
  - [ ] Review and optimize complex joins
  - [ ] Consider denormalizing some data for faster access
  - [ ] Implement database-level data transformation where possible

### 2. Optimize Student Answer Data
- [ ] Implement Row Level Security (RLS)
  - [ ] Set up RLS policies for student_answers table
  - [ ] Ensure proper data isolation between students
  - [ ] Test RLS with different user roles

- [ ] Add database indexes
  - [ ] Create index on student_id
  - [ ] Create index on submitted_at
  - [ ] Create composite index for common query patterns

- [ ] Implement client-side caching
  - [ ] Set up React Query or SWR
  - [ ] Configure appropriate cache durations
  - [ ] Implement cache invalidation strategies

### 3. Frontend Performance Improvements
- [ ] Optimize React components
  - [ ] Implement useMemo for expensive computations
  - [ ] Use useCallback for event handlers
  - [ ] Add proper loading states
  - [ ] Implement error boundaries

- [ ] Improve data loading
  - [ ] Implement pagination for large lists
  - [ ] Add infinite scrolling where appropriate
  - [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
  - [ ] Add loading skeletons

### 4. Database Structure Optimization
- [ ] Review and optimize table structure
  - [ ] Consider denormalization for frequently accessed data
  - [ ] Review foreign key relationships
  - [ ] Optimize column types and constraints

- [ ] Implement database-level caching
  - [ ] Set up materialized views for complex queries
  - [ ] Configure query result caching
  - [ ] Monitor and optimize query performance

### 5. Monitoring and Analytics
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
  - [ ] Implement error tracking
  - [ ] Add performance metrics collection
  - [ ] Set up logging for slow queries

- [ ] Add analytics
  - [ ] Track user interaction patterns
  - [ ] Monitor cache hit rates
  - [ ] Track query performance

### 6. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Implement performance testing
  - [ ] Create load testing scenarios
  - [ ] Test with different data volumes
  - [ ] Validate RLS performance

- [ ] Add monitoring alerts
  - [ ] Set up alerts for slow queries
  - [ ] Monitor cache hit rates
  - [ ] Track error rates

### 7. Documentation
- [ ] Update technical documentation
  - [ ] Document caching strategy
  - [ ] Add performance optimization guidelines
  - [ ] Document RLS policies

- [ ] Create maintenance guides
  - [ ] Add cache invalidation procedures
  - [ ] Document performance monitoring
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guides

## Priority Order
1. Implement RLS and basic caching (highest priority)
2. Add database indexes
3. Optimize frontend components
4. Implement monitoring
5. Add documentation
6. Set up advanced caching strategies
7. Implement analytics (lowest priority)

## Notes
- Each task should be implemented and tested independently
- Monitor performance metrics before and after each change
- Keep track of any performance regressions
- Document any significant changes to the caching strategy

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
