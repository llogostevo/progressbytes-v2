## API Endpoint

The system uses `/api/generate-questions` endpoint which:
- Accepts curriculum specifications and question type requirements
- Calls OpenAI GPT-4 API
- Returns structured question data
- Handles errors gracefully

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Form validation before generation
- API error handling
- Database error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Toast notifications for success/failure

## Cost Considerations

- Each question generation request uses GPT-4 tokens
- Costs depend on the complexity and number of questions
- Monitor your OpenAI usage in the dashboard
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"OpenAI API key not configured"**
   - Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
   - Restart your development server after adding the key

2. **"Failed to generate questions"**
   - Check your OpenAI API key is valid
   - Ensure you have sufficient API credits
   - Check the console for detailed error messages

3. **"No questions were generated"**
   - Try with more detailed specification content
   - Ensure at least one question type is selected
   - Check that the curriculum specification is comprehensive

### Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your OpenAI API key and credits
3. Ensure all required fields are filled
4. Try with simpler curriculum specifications first

## Security Notes

- Never commit your API key to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production
- Monitor API usage to prevent unexpected costs
